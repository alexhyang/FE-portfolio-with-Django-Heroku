# SPA1-english-vocabulary-app
This single page application is a personal English vocabulary application.

## v0.1 (Django + JavaScript)
App receives a sentence or paragraph of plain text and count the frequency of each word used in the text. Then the page will show the results in a frequency table.

## v0.2
The frequency table will be sort the entries by frequency from high to low. Entries with the same frequency will be sorted alphabetically.

## v0.3
Users can create an account and save their frequency table as a list.


## future version ideas
- replace the frequency table with word cloud
- dynamic Chrome dictionary extension for online article readings (updated when scrolling the window)
