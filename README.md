# Portfolio site
This site is a portfolio website demonstrating my front end web development skills. It contains two major parts, static web pages and an web application (English vocabulary app).

# Static HTML pages
The static pages are inspired by [freecodecamp responsive web design projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects) and integrate the Personal Portfolio Webpage, the Product Landing Page, and the Tribute page into the same project.

## English-vocabulary-app
This single page application is a personal English vocabulary application.

### v0.1 (Django + JavaScript)
new features:
- App receives a sentence or paragraph of plain text and counts the frequency of each word used in the text. The page will then show the results in a frequency table.

### v0.2 (Django + database)
new features:
- Users can now create accounts to save results in their word list.

### v0.3 (Django + dictionary APIs)
expected new features:
- The meaning of saved words will be automatically fetched using dictionary APIs (Oxford and Merriam Webster) and displayed on list page.

### future version ideas
- Users can save certain words in frequency table using checkbox
- spaced repetition word review practice
- dynamic Chrome dictionary extension for online article readings (updated when scrolling the window)
